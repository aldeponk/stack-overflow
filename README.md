# stack-overflow

We intend here to set up an API to predict StackOverflow tags 
to help people tagging their question and make StackOverflow
work better in providing a more accurate answer based on a fine guided research.


The API relies on a prediction model tuned on two basis:

- non supervised approch implementing LDA
- supervised approch implementing CNN on labeled dataset
