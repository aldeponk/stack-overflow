Hello, I am developing a new application in django with html and javascript and I need to create a new table in a sql-server database. Can you tell me how to do it ? Thanks !

I run a python script and I have a memory problem, it says it is a language problem. Can you help me ?

I have a java class with a function defined in it. How can I run this function from command line ?

I am developing a react native app and I have a problem of compatibility on iphone. Should I turn to a javascript application ?
